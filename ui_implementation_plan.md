# Faction Manager UI Implementation Plan

## Completed Fixes

### 1. SQLite Threading Issues
- **Problem**: SQLite connections could only be used in the thread they were created in, causing errors during turn processing.
- **Solution**: Modified the DatabaseManager to use thread-local storage for connections.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `threading.local()` to store connection per thread
  - Updated all connection access to use thread-local storage
  - Modified connection handling to ensure proper thread safety
  - Used queue-based approach for turn processing to avoid threading issues

### 2. Action Creation During Task Assignment
- **Problem**: Turn resolution was processing 0 actions despite pieces having task assignments.
- **Solution**: Fixed the agent and squadron repository methods to properly pass manual modifiers to database actions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added manual_modifier parameter to assign_task methods in both AgentRepository and SquadronRepository
  - Updated task object to include manual_modifier value
  - Fixed action creation to use the passed manual_modifier instead of hardcoding 0
  - Updated UI panels to pass the manual_modifier from the UI to repository methods
  - Ensured all actions are properly created and saved for the current turn

### 3. Piece Assignment UI Issues
- **Problem**: The UI was not properly showing piece assignments and defaulting to monitoring.
- **Solution**: Updated the piece panel to properly show and update task assignments.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added a task column to the piece tree to show current assignments
  - Modified assignment form to properly show current task details
  - Updated UI refresh logic to immediately reflect changes
  - Fixed proper task type formatting in the UI

### 4. Piece Assignment Persistence Issue
- **Problem**: Assigned pieces would lose their assignments after navigating away from the piece panel and returning.
- **Solution**: Standardized the approach to accessing and setting combobox values throughout the code.
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed inconsistency between using StringVar-based methods and direct combobox methods
  - Standardized on using combobox methods (combo.get() and combo.set()) throughout the code
  - Added detailed logging to track assignment saving, loading, and display
  - Updated all affected methods (_update_assignment_form, _assign_task, _on_task_changed, etc.)
  - Added verification after assignment to ensure assignments were correctly persisted

### 5. Turn Processing Handling
- **Problem**: Turn processing had threading issues and missing handler methods.
- **Solution**: Updated turn processing to use a queue-based approach and restored handler methods.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added queue-based processing instead of separate threads
  - Restored result handler methods that were removed
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Fixed action_manager reference in the TurnPanel

### 6. Repository Logging Error with Model Attributes
- **Problem**: The base repository was trying to log `district_id` and `current_task` attributes for all models, but only Agent and Squadron models have these attributes.
- **Solution**: Modified the logging statement to only log attributes that are guaranteed to exist on all models.
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed references to `model.district_id` and `model.current_task` in the logging statement
  - Simplified the logging to only show model class name and ID
  - Fixed errors when loading District and Faction models through repositories
  - Allows district creation and selection to work properly in the UI

### 7. Piece Assignment Panel Filter Bug
- **Problem**: The piece assignment panel wasn't showing any pieces despite pieces being available, showing "Loaded 0 pieces" at the bottom.
- **Solution**: Fixed the discrepancy between filter variable initialization and dropdown values.
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed the mismatch between the filter variables ("all") and the actual combobox values ("All Factions", "All Districts")
  - Updated the _load_pieces method to use actual combobox values instead of variables
  - Fixed the _load_factions and _load_districts methods to properly initialize comboboxes with text values
  - Added detailed logging to diagnose filtering issues
  - Improved filter change handling to better clear selections and update the display
  - Added null handling for empty filter values

### 8. Redundant Quality Tier Parameter in Monitoring
- **Problem**: The `_process_monitoring_result` method in `MonitoringManager` redundantly required a quality tier parameter even though it can be determined directly from the roll result.
- **Solution**: Modified the method to calculate the quality tier internally instead of requiring it as a parameter.
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed the `quality_tier` parameter from the `_process_monitoring_result` method signature
  - Added internal calculation of quality tier using the existing `_determine_quality_tier` method
  - Updated all calls to `_process_monitoring_result` to remove the redundant parameter
  - Updated the turn resolution logic to get the quality tier separately for display purposes
  - Verified that this simplification maintains the same behavior while reducing potential bugs from mismatched roll/tier values

### 9. Map Panel Missing Imports
- **Problem**: The Map Panel crashed when creating a new district with the error: `NameError: name 'simpledialog' is not defined`
- **Solution**: Added missing imports for `simpledialog` and `District` class.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added import for `simpledialog` from tkinter package
  - Added import for `District` class from models package
  - Verified the fix allows creating new districts from the map panel
  - Tested the district creation workflow to ensure it works end-to-end

### 10. Map Visualization Transparency Fix
- **Problem**: District shapes were obscuring the base map with colored fills and borders, making it difficult to see map details.
- **Solution**: Modified both the live map view and exported maps to have fully transparent district shapes with no borders.
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated the `_draw_district` method in `MapPanel` to:
    - Set fill color to "" (empty string) for complete transparency
    - Remove borders by setting outline to "" and width to 0
    - Add white outline to district text labels for better visibility against any background
  - Updated the `_generate_faction_map` method in `FactionMapGenerator` to:
    - Remove the district polygon drawing code that was adding a semi-transparent fill
    - Add white outline to district name and confidence text for better readability
    - Keep influence dots and stronghold markers visible
  - Updated the `save_dm_map` method in `FactionMapGenerator` to follow the same approach
  - Tested the changes in both the UI and exported maps

### Benefits:
- Base map details are now fully visible through the districts
- District boundaries are defined only by text labels and influence dots
- Text is more readable with white outline against any background
- Map visualization focuses on the most important elements (influence distribution) without visual clutter
- Consistent appearance between UI and exported maps

## Map Visualization Improvements

### 1. Random Distribution of Influence Dots and Strongholds

#### Problem:
- Influence dots and stronghold stars were being placed in a structured grid pattern around the center of districts, rather than being distributed throughout the entire district shape.
- This made it difficult to see the true coverage of influence across a district, especially for larger or irregularly shaped districts.

#### Solution:
- Implemented a uniform random distribution algorithm for both influence dots and stronghold stars.
- Used rejection sampling to ensure points are only placed within the district polygon boundaries.
- Added fallback mechanisms to handle cases where random placement might fail.

#### Implementation:
- Modified `_draw_influence_dots` in `MapPanel` to:
  - Calculate the district's bounding box (min/max x/y)
  - Generate random points within this box
  - Use point-in-polygon testing to verify each point is inside the district shape
  - Only place dots inside the polygon boundaries
  - Add a fallback to centroid placement with jitter if random placement fails

- Modified `_draw_stronghold` in `MapPanel` to:
  - Use the same random placement algorithm as influence dots
  - Ensure strongholds are clearly visible regardless of where they're placed
  - Maintain the star shape distinctive appearance

- Applied the same improvements to `FactionMapGenerator` for exported maps:
  - Updated `_draw_influence_dots` to use rejection sampling for random placement
  - Modified `_draw_strongholds` to distribute strongholds randomly within districts
  - Added a new helper method `_place_stronghold_in_polygon` to handle the random placement
  - Added a `_point_in_polygon` utility method to ensure points are inside district boundaries

### 2. Configurable Visualization Element Sizes

#### Problem:
- Text sizes, influence dot sizes, and stronghold star sizes were hardcoded throughout the codebase.
- There was no easy way to adjust these values for better visibility or to accommodate different map scales.

#### Solution:
- Consolidated all visualization size parameters in clearly defined class properties.
- Added intuitive naming and comments to make these parameters easier to find and modify.
- Ensured consistent parameter organization in both live map view and exported maps.

#### Implementation:
- In `MapPanel`:
  - Grouped all configurable size parameters at the top of the class:
    - `district_name_font_size`: Base font size for district names
    - `confidence_text_font_size`: Base font size for confidence text
    - `influence_dot_radius`: Size of influence dots
    - `stronghold_size`: Size of stronghold stars
  - Updated methods to reference these parameters consistently

- In `FactionMapGenerator`:
  - Grouped and documented the equivalent parameters:
    - `influence_dot_radius`: Size of influence dots
    - `stronghold_size`: Size of stronghold stars
    - `district_name_font_size`: Font size for district names
    - `confidence_font_size`: Font size for confidence ratings
  - Ensured parameter naming consistency with the MapPanel class

### Benefits:
- More realistic and visually appealing distribution of influence markers across districts
- Better representation of faction presence throughout district territories
- Influence dots and stronghold markers can now appear in any part of a district, including corners
- Easy customization of visual element sizes through well-documented parameters
- Consistent visualization style between live map view and exported map images

### Testing Verification:
- Confirmed influence dots are now correctly distributed across the entire district area
- Verified stronghold stars are randomly placed within district boundaries
- Checked that the system properly handles irregularly shaped districts
- Verified that changing size parameters correctly affects the visual appearance
- Confirmed consistent behavior between interactive and exported maps

## Turn Resolution Panel Bug Fix

### Problem Identified:
In the Turn Resolution panel, the Influence Decay and Action Roll sub-panels were not showing any data, while the Action Resolution panel displayed correctly. Our investigation revealed:

1. The data for these panels was being correctly processed in the backend
2. The data was being stored in `self.current_results` after turn part 1 processing
3. After turn processing, the UI automatically switched to the Conflict Resolution tab (as designed)
4. The issue was that users had no way to navigate back to the Influence Decay or Action Roll tabs to see the processed data

### Root Cause:
The turn workflow was designed to advance through phases linearly, but didn't provide a way for users to view the results of previous phases once they had completed. While the data was available, it wasn't accessible through the UI.

### Solution Implemented:
1. Added a row of navigation buttons in the Results panel to allow users to:
   - View Influence Decay results
   - View Action Roll results
   - View Action Resolution results
   - View Monitoring results
   - Return to the current phase

2. Modified the turn processing logic to:
   - Load data for the Influence Decay and Action Roll tabs before switching to the Conflict Resolution tab
   - Inform users about the ability to view detailed results using the new buttons
   - Make the notebook tabs accessible at any time, regardless of the current phase

3. Added a `_load_data_for_phase` method that can load data for a specific phase without changing the current phase

### Benefits:
- Users can now access all processed data at any point during the turn resolution
- The UI maintains its workflow guidance by still automatically advancing to the appropriate tab
- The fix aligns with the principle of making all relevant information accessible while still guiding the user through the process

### Future Improvements:
- Consider highlighting panels that contain new data to draw user attention
- Add visual indicators showing which phases have been completed
- Create a consolidated view option that shows a summary of all results

## Enemy Penalty Tracking Fix

### Problem Identified:
The enemy penalty system had several issues with how penalties were being applied during action resolution:

1. Agents were applying penalties to multiple targets, when they should only apply one penalty total per turn
2. Squadrons were applying penalties to more targets than their mobility allowed
3. Penalties weren't being tracked between different action rolls during the action resolution phase
4. There was no proper enforcement of maximum targets across all actions

### Root Cause:
The penalty calculation was being handled independently for each action with no shared state between calls. The system was:
1. Calculating penalties locally for each action without tracking previous penalties applied by the same piece
2. Using a per-action "applied_agents" tracking list that reset between actions
3. Applying the squadron mobility limits within a single action calculation but not across the entire phase

### Solution Implemented:
1. Created a `PenaltyTracker` class to maintain state throughout the action resolution phase:
   - Tracks which agents have already applied penalties
   - Tracks how many penalties each squadron has applied based on mobility rules
   - Provides methods to check if penalties can be applied and to record applications

2. Updated the ActionManager:
   - Added a penalty_tracker property initialized to None
   - Added a reset_penalty_tracker method to create a fresh tracker at the beginning of action resolution
   - Updated enemy penalty calculation methods to use the tracker

3. Modified the turn resolution process:
   - Added code to reset the penalty tracker at the start of the action roll phase
   - Ensured this reset happens before processing any actions
   - Added logging to track penalty application throughout the phase

4. Updated squadron penalty tracking logic:
   - Moved the max targets calculation into the PenaltyTracker class
   - Implemented proper target slot allocation (same_district, adjacent_district, either_district)
   - Added validation to ensure penalties respect mobility limitations

### Benefits:
- Agents now correctly apply only one penalty total across the entire action resolution phase
- Squadrons respect their mobility limits when applying penalties across multiple targets
- Penalties are applied fairly and consistently regardless of which actions are processed first
- The system correctly enforces the specified game mechanics

### Testing Verification:
- Validated that the PenaltyTracker class correctly tracks applied penalties
- Confirmed agents only apply their one penalty across the entire turn
- Verified squadron penalty allocation based on mobility values
- Checked penalty breakdown in roll results to ensure proper application
- Confirmed that the tracker is properly reset at the beginning of each turn's action resolution phase

## Testing Approach

### 1. Piece Assignment Testing
- **Test Steps**:
  - Select a piece in the piece list
  - Assign it to a district and task
  - Verify task immediately shows in the task column
  - Reselect the piece and verify assignment form shows correct details
  - Navigate away from the piece panel and return to verify assignments are preserved
  - Change the assignment and verify the update is reflected
  - Clear the assignment and verify it's properly cleared

### 2. Turn Processing Testing
- **Test Steps**:
  - Assign pieces to various tasks
  - Click "Process Turn Part 1" button
  - Verify processing completes without errors
  - Check conflict detection and resolution if applicable
  - Process "Turn Part 2" if no conflicts or after resolving them
  - Verify turn completes successfully
  - Check influence changes and monitoring results

### 3. Thread Safety Testing
- **Test Steps**:
  - Run operations that require database access in rapid succession
  - Process turn while performing other database operations
  - Run multiple operations concurrently to stress test threading
  - Verify no SQLite threading errors occur

### 4. Filter Functionality Testing
- **Test Steps**:
  - Open the piece assignment panel and verify all pieces are shown by default
  - Test each filter individually (faction, district, type, task)
  - Test combinations of filters
  - Verify the piece count displayed at the bottom reflects the actual filtered count
  - Test search functionality to ensure it filters correctly
  - Verify that changing a filter properly updates the displayed pieces

## Future Improvements

### 1. UI Enhancements
- Add loading indicators during long operations
- Implement more granular progress tracking during turn processing
- Add auto-refresh triggers when database changes occur

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Review database query patterns for potential optimizations
- Consider batching database operations for better performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### 3. Error Handling
- Enhance error reporting with more detailed messages
- Add recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations
- Implement automatic save points before critical operations

## Map Functionality Testing Plan

### 1. District Creation and Editing
- **Test Steps**:
  - Enable Edit Mode in the Map Panel
  - Create a new district using the "New District" button
  - Draw district points on the map
  - Save the district shape
  - Edit existing district by selecting and modifying its points
  - Verify district changes are persisted to the database
  - Test color changes for both fill and border colors

### 2. Map Navigation
- **Test Steps**:
  - Test zooming in/out using mouse wheel
  - Test zooming using the slider and +/- buttons
  - Test panning by dragging the map
  - Verify the "Reset View" button works correctly
  - Ensure district shapes scale properly when zooming
  - Check if text labels remain readable at different zoom levels

### 3. View Modes
- **Test Steps**:
  - Switch between DM view and faction-specific views
  - Verify faction views only show influence known to that faction
  - Test that strongholds appear correctly for each faction
  - Ensure color-coding matches faction colors defined in the database
  - Verify the visualization updates after influence changes

### 4. Base Map Management
- **Test Steps**:
  - Test importing different base maps
  - Verify district shapes adjust properly when changing maps
  - Check if coordinate scaling works correctly
  - Test that the map state is properly saved between application runs

## Conflict Resolution Improvements

### 1. Automatic Draw Selection

#### Problem:
- In the conflict resolution UI, when selecting "Draw" as the resolution type, users still had to manually select which factions would be in a draw.
- This was redundant and confusing, as in a draw situation, all involved factions should automatically be considered in a draw.

#### Solution:
- Modified the conflict resolution UI to automatically mark all factions as drawing when the "Draw" option is selected.
- Removed the need for manual faction selection in draw resolutions.

#### Implementation:
- Updated `_apply_conflict_resolution` method in `TurnPanel` to:
  - Automatically add all conflict factions to the draw_factions list when "draw" is selected
  - Remove the validation check for selected factions in draw mode
  - Simplify the user experience by removing an unnecessary selection step
- Modified `_update_resolution_form` method to:
  - Hide the draw factions selection listbox when in "draw" mode since it's no longer needed
  - Keep the UI clear and focused on only the necessary inputs

### 2. Prevention of Pieces in Multiple Conflicts

#### Problem:
- Pieces (agents/squadrons) could be assigned to multiple conflicts in the same turn
- This caused unrealistic scenarios where a single piece could be involved in battles in different districts or multiple conflicts in the same district

#### Solution:
- Implemented a check system to prevent pieces from being added to multiple conflicts in the same turn
- Added logic that checks if a piece is already involved in a conflict before adding it to a new one

#### Implementation:
- Added a new helper method `_is_piece_in_conflict` to check if a piece is already in a conflict:
  - Queries the conflict_pieces table joined with conflicts to check for existing conflicts in the current turn
  - Returns true if the piece is already involved in any conflict
- Updated the following methods to use this check:
  - `_create_conflict`: Added check before adding initiating and target pieces
  - `_add_target_faction_pieces`: Added check before adding target faction pieces
  - `_detect_adjacent_participation`: Added check before adding squadrons from adjacent districts
  - Refactored adjacent participation detection into a cleaner, more modular structure with:
    - Simplified main detection loop 
    - New helper method `_add_squadron_to_conflict` for better code organization
- Added detailed logging to track which pieces are skipped due to being already in conflicts

### Benefits:
- More realistic conflict system where each piece can only participate in one conflict per turn
- Simplified draw resolution with an intuitive "all factions draw" model
- Improved data consistency by preventing unrealistic multiple-conflict participation
- Better user experience with fewer required clicks to resolve conflicts
- Cleaner, more maintainable code structure for the conflict resolution system

### Testing Verification:
- Confirmed that selecting "Draw" now automatically includes all involved factions
- Verified that pieces already in conflicts are skipped when detecting new conflicts
- Checked that adjacent district participation correctly respects the single-conflict rule
- Validated that manual conflict initiation works properly with the new checks
- Ensured the complete conflict resolution workflow functions as expected

## Conflict Detection Enhancement

### Problem:
- Conflicts were being created even when one or both sides had no actual available pieces
- This resulted in empty conflicts or conflicts with only one faction having pieces
- Conflicts could be created even when all pieces were already assigned to other conflicts

### Solution:
- Implemented validation to ensure conflicts are only created when both participating factions have available pieces
- Added checks to verify pieces aren't already involved in other conflicts before creating a new conflict
- Enhanced all conflict detection mechanisms to validate piece availability

### Implementation:
1. **Availability Checking Helper:**
   - Added new `_faction_has_available_pieces_in_district` method to check if a faction has any pieces available for conflict
   - Method queries all faction pieces in a district and checks if any are not already in a conflict
   - Provides a consistent way to verify piece availability before conflict creation

2. **Manual Conflict Improvements:**
   - Updated `_detect_manual_conflicts` to:
     - Check if the initiating piece is already in another conflict
     - Verify that the target faction has at least one available piece in the district
     - Skip conflict creation if either condition fails
     - Added detailed logging to track skipped conflicts

3. **Relationship Conflict Improvements:**
   - Enhanced `_create_relationship_conflict` to:
     - Filter out pieces that are already in conflicts
     - Build filtered lists of available pieces for both factions
     - Only create conflicts when both sides have at least one available piece
     - Use only available pieces when creating the conflict
   - Updated `_detect_relationship_conflicts` to:
     - Add preliminary check using `_faction_has_available_pieces_in_district`
     - Skip conflict generation attempts when either faction lacks available pieces
     - Use clearer variable names for better code readability

4. **Target Conflict Improvements:**
   - Modified `_detect_target_conflicts` to:
     - Check if either piece involved is already in a different conflict
     - Skip conflict creation if either piece is unavailable
     - Add detailed logging when conflicts are skipped

5. **Adjacent Participation Improvements:**
   - Updated `_detect_adjacent_participation` to:
     - Verify conflicts have at least 2 factions and 2 pieces before processing
     - Skip adjacent participation for invalid or empty conflicts
     - Continue checking if squadrons are already in conflicts before adding them

### Benefits:
- More realistic conflict system where conflicts only occur when there are actual opposing pieces
- Prevented creation of invalid or nonsensical conflicts with missing participants
- Improved system efficiency by avoiding processing empty conflicts
- Better data consistency with conflicts always having proper representation from both sides
- Enhanced logging makes it easier to understand which conflicts are being skipped and why

### Testing:
- Verified conflicts are only created when both sides have available pieces
- Confirmed that pieces already in conflicts aren't assigned to additional conflicts
- Tested that relationship conflicts properly filter for available pieces
- Validated that target conflicts check piece availability correctly
- Confirmed that adjacent district participation respects the availability rules

## Enemy Penalty Fix

### Problem Identified
- Enemy penalties were not being correctly applied to action rolls due to incorrect parameter binding in SQL queries
- The SQL query was using `:faction_id` parameter when it should have been using `:enemy_id` 
- The UI did not display enemy penalties clearly in the action roll breakdown
- Users had no easy way to diagnose relationship issues between factions

### Solution
1. Fixed SQL query parameters in ActionManager:
   - Updated `_calculate_enemy_agent_penalties` to correctly use the `enemy_id` parameter
   - Updated `_calculate_enemy_squadron_penalties` to correctly use the `enemy_id` parameter
   - Added enhanced error logging and debugging information

2. Improved UI for enemy penalty display:
   - Updated `_reconstruct_roll_breakdown` in TurnPanel to show enemy penalties even when zero
   - Added explanatory text for why no enemy penalties were applied
   - Improved formatting of the roll calculation display
   - Added detailed breakdown of enemy penalties with source information

3. Added diagnostic tools:
   - Created a relationship diagnostic tool in the ActionPanel
   - Added faction relationship matrix visualization
   - Added enemy penalty calculation debugging
   - Display pieces in shared districts with relationship status

### Testing Approach
1. Create negative relationships between factions
2. Position agents/squadrons from enemy factions in the same district
3. Create and execute actions with these agents
4. Verify enemy penalties are correctly applied in the roll calculation
5. Use the diagnostic tool to confirm relationships are correctly stored
6. Check the detailed breakdown in the roll calculation view

### Future Improvements
- Add visual indicators in the district view for enemy factions
- Add relationship tooltips when hovering over factions
- Create a standalone relationship management panel
- Add automated notifications when pieces from hostile factions occupy the same district

## Assignment Panel Improvements

### 1. Bulk Task Assignment Feature

#### Problem:
- Users had to manually click through and assign each task individually in the UI
- This was time-consuming when multiple pieces needed to be assigned
- There was no easy way to ensure all pieces had their assignments saved for turn processing

#### Solution:
- Added a new "Assign All Tasks" button to the Assignment Panel
- Implemented functionality to automatically assign all non-unassigned pieces to their currently set tasks
- Handled both agents and squadrons in a single operation

#### Implementation:
- Added a new button in the Assignment Panel's button frame:
  ```python
  self.assign_all_button = ttk.Button(self.button_frame, text="Assign All Tasks", command=self._assign_all_tasks)
  self.assign_all_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=5)
  ```
- Implemented the `_assign_all_tasks` method to:
  - Retrieve all agents and squadrons from their repositories
  - Skip pieces that are unassigned or have no current task
  - Use the existing `update_task` methods to assign each piece to its currently displayed task
  - Show a confirmation dialog before proceeding
  - Display a summary of successful assignments and any errors
  - Reload the pieces list to reflect changes

#### Benefits:
- Significant time savings when assigning multiple pieces
- Ensures all pieces have their tasks properly registered in the database
- Reduces the chance of missing task assignments before turn processing
- Provides clear feedback on the number of tasks assigned
- Maintains consistency with the existing task assignment workflow
- Preserves all task parameters (manual modifiers, attributes, skills, etc.)

#### Testing Verification:
- Confirmed the "Assign All Tasks" button appears in the Assignment Panel
- Verified that non-unassigned pieces are correctly assigned to their current tasks
- Checked that pieces with no task or district are properly skipped
- Confirmed that error handling works correctly for invalid assignments
- Verified that the pieces list is refreshed to show the updated assignments
- Tested with a mix of agents and squadrons to ensure both types are handled correctly

## Conclusion

The most critical issues have been addressed, focusing on thread safety and UI consistency. The application now properly handles SQLite connections across threads and shows accurate piece assignments. The issue with piece assignments being lost after navigation has been fixed by standardizing combobox access methods. Turn processing has been redesigned to avoid threading issues while maintaining functionality.

Further testing in actual gameplay will help identify any remaining edge cases or usability issues that need to be addressed.
